## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  

The cartoonization process consists of the following steps:  

1. **Edge Detection**  
   Detects the edges in the image using adaptive thresholding.  

2. **Color Quantization**  
   Reduces the color palette using K-means clustering.  

3. **Bilateral Filtering**  
   Applies smoothing while retaining edges for a cartoon effect.   

4. **Final Cartoon Effect**  
   Combines the processed layers to produce the cartoonized image.
